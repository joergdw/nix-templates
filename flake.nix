          You have just created a template for a cloud-native rust-application running
          on cloudfoundry and built via a cloud-native buildpack.

          To perform a minimal run, you need to configure appropriate values for
          `DOCKER_REGISTRY` and `DOCKER_REPOSITORY` in the Makefile and an appropriate
          route in the manifest. See comments in those files. You additionally
          need a working cloudfoundry-user and cloudfoundry-space.

          For more on cloud-native buildpacks, see: <https://buildpacks.io>

          There are some things you need to adapt following the `ðŸš§ To-do`-comments in the flake.nix-file:
            + Se the branch for nixos, to use in `nixpkgs.url`.
            + Adapt package-name and version-identifier.
            + Use cargo-lock file or switch to another mechanisms to ensure reproducability.

          In the cargo.toml, you should adapt the package-name accordingly.

          And in the manifest.yaml you need to adapt the following things:
            + Adapt the app-name.
            + You must set the route.

          There are as well some `ðŸš§ To-do`-comments in the Makefile.
            + Adapt docker-registry and repository.
            + Adapt the project-name.

          You have just created a template for a declarative system-configuration
          with Nix.

          It contains an examle-package that you can install via `nix profile install '.#default'`.
          That package is a collection of the listed software. You can add or remove anything
          in the list and after an update, the installed software will be adapted. See the
          comments in the flake.nix.

          There are some things you need to adapt following the `ðŸš§ To-do`-comments in the
          flake.nix-file:
            + Se the branch for nixos, to use in `nixpkgs.url`.
            + The parameter for `supported_system`.
            + Set `config.allowUnfree = true;` if you need to inlcude non-free software into your
              collections.
            + Select additional outputs;
            + Install the default-package;
            + Check if the manpages are accessible from commandline.
            + Check if the shell-completion works. If not, follow the instructions in the comments
              of the flake.nix-file.
